//! Implementation of a highly-scalable and ergonomic actor model for Rust
//! # Axiom
//!
//! Axiom brings a highly-scalable actor model to the Rust language based on the many lessons
//! learned over years of Actor model implementations in Akka and Erlang. This library is,
//! however, not a direct re-implementation of either of the two aforementioned actor models but
//! rather a new implementation deriving inspiration from the good parts of those models.
//!
//! ## What is an Actor Model
//!
//! An actor model is an architectural asynchronous programming paradigm characterized by the use
//! of actors for all processing activities. Actors have the following characteristics:
//! 1. An actor can be interacted with only by means of messages.
//! 2. An actor processes only one message at a time.
//! 3. An actor will process a message only once.
//! 4. An actor can send a message to any other actor without knowledge of that actor's internals.
//! 5. Actors send only immutable data as messages, though they may have mutable internal state.
//! 6. Actors are location agnostic. An actor can be sent a message from anywhere in the cluster.
//!
//! Note that for the purposes of Rust, rule five cannot be enforced by this library but is
//! important for users of the library developing actors based on this library. In Erlang and
//! Elixir this rule cannot be violated because of the structure of the language but that leads to
//! limitations as well because Erlang and Elixir actors cannot hold internal mutable state.
//!
//! What is important to understand is that these rules combined together makes each actor operate
//! like a micro-service in the memory space of the program using them. Since actor messages are
//! immutable, actors can trade information safely and easily without copying large data structures.
//!
//! ## Getting Started
//!
//! Although programming in the actor model is quite an involved process you can get started with
//! Axiom in only a few lines of code.
//!
//! ```rust
//! use axiom::actors::*;
//! use std::sync::Arc;
//!
//! let system = ActorSystem::create(10, 1);
//!
//! let aid = ActorSystem::spawn(&system,
//!     0 as usize,
//!     |_state: &mut usize, _aid: Arc<ActorId>, message: &Arc<Message>| Status::Processed,
//!  );
//!
//! ActorId::send(&aid, Arc::new(11));
//! ```
//!
//! This code creates an an actor system and then spawns an actor and finally sends the actor a
//! message. That is really all there is to it but of course it doesn't end there. If you want
//! to create an actor with a struct that is simple as well. Let's create one that handles a
//! couple of message types.
//!
//! ```rust
//! use axiom::actors::*;
//! use std::sync::Arc;
//!
//! let system = ActorSystem::create(10, 1);
//!
//! struct Data {
//!     value: i32,
//! }
//!
//! impl Data {
//!     fn handle_bool(&mut self, _aid: Arc<ActorId>, message: &bool) -> Status {
//!         if *message {
//!             self.value += 1;
//!         } else {
//!             self.value -= 1;
//!         }
//!         Status::Processed // assertion will fail but we still have to return.
//!     }
//!
//!     fn handle_i32(&mut self, _aid: Arc<ActorId>, message: &i32) -> Status {
//!         self.value += *message;
//!         Status::Processed // assertion will fail but we still have to return.
//!     }
//!
//!     fn handle(&mut self, aid: Arc<ActorId>, message: &Arc<Message>) -> Status {
//!         if let Some(msg) = message.downcast_ref::<bool>() {
//!             self.handle_bool(aid, msg)
//!         } else if let Some(msg) = message.downcast_ref::<i32>() {
//!             self.handle_i32(aid, msg)
//!         } else {
//!             assert!(false, "Failed to dispatch properly");
//!             Status::Stop // assertion will fail but we still have to return.
//!         }
//!     }
//! }
//!
//! let data = Data { value: 0 };
//!
//! let aid = ActorSystem::spawn(&system, data, Data::handle);
//!
//! ActorId::send(&aid, Arc::new(11));
//! ActorId::send(&aid, Arc::new(true));
//! ActorId::send(&aid, Arc::new(true));
//! ActorId::send(&aid, Arc::new(false));
//! ```
//!
//! This code creates an actor out of an arbitrary struct. Since the only requirement to make
//! an actor is to have a function that is compliant with the [axiom::actors::Processor] trait,
//! anything can be an actor. If this struct had been declared somewhere outside of your control
//! you could use it in an actor as state by declaring your own handler function and making the
//! calls to the 3rd party structure.
//!
//! *It's important to keep in mind that the starting state is moved into the actor and you
//! will not have external access to it afterwards.* This is by design and although you could
//! conceivably use a `std::sync::Arc` to a structure as state, that would definitely be a bad
//! idea as it would break the rules for actors.
//!
//! There is a lot more to learn and explore and your best resource is the test code for Axiom.
//! The developers have a belief that test code should be well architected and well commented to
//! act also as a set of examples.
//!
