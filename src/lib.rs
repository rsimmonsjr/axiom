//! # Axiom
//!
//! Axiom brings a highly-scalable actor model to the Rust language based on the many lessons
//! learned over years of Actor model implementations in Akka and Erlang. Axiom is, however,
//! not a direct re-implementation of either of the two aforementioned actor models but
//! rather a new implementation deriving inspiration from the good parts of those projects.
//!
//! ### What's New
//! * 2019-??-??: 0.1.0
//!   * A lot of breaking changes have been introduced in an effort to keep them all in one release
//!   so that the API can stabilize. Please see examples and other sources for help in integrating
//!   all of the changes listed below.
//!   * BREAKING CHANGE: `ActorId` has been renamed to `Aid` to facilitate communication and lower
//!   confusion between the `uuid` field in the `Aid` and the `Aid` itself.
//!   * BREAKING CHANGE: `Status::Processed` has been renamed to `Status::Done`.
//!   * BREAKING CHANGE: `Status::Skipped` has been renamed to `Status::Skip`.
//!   * BREAKING CHANGE: `Status::ResetSkip` has been renamed to `Status::Reset`.
//!   * BREAKING CHANGE: `ActorError` has been moved to top level and renamed to `AxiomError`.
//!   * BREAKING CHANGE: `find_by_name` and `find_by_uuid` have been removed from `Aid` as the
//!   mechanism for looking up actors doesn't make sense the way it was before.
//!   * BREAKING CHANGE: `MessageContent` was unintentionally public and is now private.
//!   * BREAKING CHANGE: Changed `Processor` to take a `&Context` rather than `Aid`.
//!   * BREAKING CHANGE: The `send`, `send_new` and `send_after` methods now return a result type
//!   that the user must manage.
//!   * BREAKING CHANGE: All actor processors now should return `AxiomResult` which will allow them
//!   to use the `?` syntax for all functions that return `AxiomError` and return their own errors.
//!   * BREAKING CHANGE: Actors are now spawned with the builder pattern. This allows the
//!   configuration of an actor and leaves the door open for future flexibility. See documentation
//!   for more details.
//!   * Created a `Context` type that holds references to the `Aid` and `ActorSystem`.
//!   * `Processor` functions can get a reference to the `Aid` of the actor from `Context`.
//!   * `Processor` functions can get a reference to the `ActorSystem` from `Context`.
//!   * The methods `find_aid_by_uuid` and `find_aid_by_name` are added to the `ActorSystem`.
//!   * Calling `system.init_current()` is unneeded unless deserializing `Aid`s outside a
//!   `Processor`.
//!   * Metrics methods like `received()` in `Aid` return `Result` instead of using `panic!`.
//!   * Changed internal maps to use crate `dashmap` which expands dependencies but increases
//!   performance.
//!   * New methods `send_new` and `send_new_after` are available to shorten boilerplate.
//!   * Added a named system actor, which is registered under the name `System`, that is started
//!   as the 1st actor in an `ActorSystem`.
//!   * Added a method `system_actor_aid` to easily look up the `System` actor.
//!   * Added additional configuration options to `ActorSystemConfig`.
//!   * System will warn if an actor takes longer than the configured `warn_threshold` to process a
//!   message.
//!   * Instead of processing one message per receive, the system will now process pending messages
//!   up until the configured `time_slice`, allowing optimized processing for quick messages.
//!   * The default `message_channel_size` for actors is now configurable for the actor system as
//!   a whole.
//!   * Instead of waiting forever on a send, the system will wait for the configured
//!   `send_timeout` before returning a timeout error to the caller.
//!
//! [Release Notes for All Versions](https://github.com/rsimmonsjr/axiom/blob/master/RELEASE_NOTES.md)
//!
//! # Getting Started
//!
//! *An actor model is an architectural asynchronous programming paradigm characterized by the use
//! of actors for all processing activities.*
//!
//! Actors have the following characteristics:
//! 1. An actor can be interacted with only by means of messages.
//! 2. An actor processes only one message at a time.
//! 3. An actor will process a message only once.
//! 4. An actor can send a message to any other actor without knowledge of that actor's internals.
//! 5. Actors send only immutable data as messages, though they may have mutable internal state.
//! 6. Actors are location agnostic; they can be sent a message from anywhere in the cluster.
//!
//! Note that within the language of Rust, rule five cannot be enforced by Rust but is a best
//! practice which is important for developers creating actors based on Axiom. In Erlang and
//! Elixir rule five cannot be violated because of the structure of the language but this also
//! leads to performance limitations. It's better to allow internal mutable state and encourage
//! the good practice of not sending mutable messages.
//!
//! What is important to understand is that these rules combined together makes each actor operate
//! like a micro-service in the memory space of the program using them. Since actor messages are
//! immutable, actors can trade information safely and easily without copying large data
//! structures.
//!
//! Although programming in the actor model is quite an involved process you can get started with
//! Axiom in only a few lines of code.
//!
//! ```rust
//! use axiom::*;
//! use std::sync::Arc;
//! use std::time::Duration;
//!
//! let system = ActorSystem::create(ActorSystemConfig::default().threads_size(2));
//!
//! let aid = system
//!     .spawn()
//!     .with(
//!         0 as usize,
//!         |_state: &mut usize, _context: &Context, _message: &Message| Ok(Status::Done),
//!     )
//!     .unwrap();
//!
//! aid.send(Message::new(11)).unwrap();
//!
//! // It is worth noting that you probably wouldn't just unwrap in real code but deal with
//! // the result as a panic in Axiom will take down a dispatcher thread and potentially
//! // hang the system.
//!
//! // This will wrap the value `17` in a Message for you!
//! aid.send_new(17).unwrap();
//!
//! // We can also create and send separately using just `send`, not `send_new`.
//! let message = Message::new(19);
//! aid.send(message).unwrap();
//!
//! // Another neat capability is to send a message after some time has elapsed.
//! aid.send_after(Message::new(7), Duration::from_millis(10)).unwrap();
//! aid.send_new_after(7, Duration::from_millis(10)).unwrap();
//! ```
//! This code creates an actor system, fetches a builder for an actor via the `spawn()` method,
//! spawns an actor and finally sends the actor a message. Creating an Axiom actor is literally
//! that easy but there is a lot more functionality available as well.
//!
//! If you want to create an actor with a struct that is simple as well. Let's create one that
//! handles a couple of different message types:
//!
//! ```rust
//! use axiom::*;
//! use std::sync::Arc;
//!
//! let system = ActorSystem::create(ActorSystemConfig::default().threads_size(2));
//!
//! struct Data {
//!     value: i32,
//! }
//!
//! impl Data {
//!     fn handle_bool(&mut self, message: &bool) -> AxiomResult {
//!         if *message {
//!             self.value += 1;
//!         } else {
//!             self.value -= 1;
//!         }
//!         Ok(Status::Done)
//!     }
//!
//!     fn handle_i32(&mut self, message: &i32) -> AxiomResult {
//!         self.value += *message;
//!         Ok(Status::Done)
//!     }
//!
//!     fn handle(&mut self, _context: &Context, message: &Message) -> AxiomResult {
//!         if let Some(msg) = message.content_as::<bool>() {
//!             self.handle_bool(&*msg)
//!         } else if let Some(msg) = message.content_as::<i32>() {
//!             self.handle_i32(&*msg)
//!         } else {
//!             panic!("Failed to dispatch properly");
//!             Ok(Status::Stop)
//!         }
//!     }
//! }
//!
//! let data = Data { value: 0 };
//! let aid = system.spawn().name("Fred").with(data, Data::handle).unwrap();
//!
//! aid.send_new(11).unwrap();
//! aid.send_new(true).unwrap();
//! aid.send_new(false).unwrap();
//! ```
//!
//! This code creates a named actor out of an arbitrary struct. Since the only requirement to make
//! an actor is to have a function that is compliant with the [`axiom::actors::Processor`] trait,
//! anything can be an actor. If this struct had been declared somewhere outside of your control
//! you could use it in an actor as state by declaring your own handler function and making the
//! calls to the 3rd party structure.
//!
//! *It's important to keep in mind that the starting state is moved into the actor and you
//! will not have external access to it afterwards.* This is by design and although you could
//! conceivably use a [`Arc`] or [`Mutex`] enclosing a structure as state, that would definitely
//! be a bad idea as it would break the rules we laid out for actors.
//!
//! There is a lot more to learn and explore and your best resource is the test code for Axiom.
//! The developers have a belief that test code should be well architected and well commented to
//! act as a set of examples for users of Axiom.
//!

//! obligatory introduction to any computer system.

//! example of how to use Axiom for parallel computation.
//!
//! ## Design Principals of Axiom
//!
//! Based on previous experience with other actor models I wanted to design Axiom around some
//! core principles:
//! 1. **At its core an actor is just an function that processes messages.** The simplest actor is
//! a function that takes a message and simply ignores it. The benefit to the functional approach
//! over the Akka model is that it allows the user to create actors easily and simply. This is
//! the notion of _micro module programming_; the notion of building a complex system from the
//! smallest components. Software based on the actor model can get complicated; keeping it simple
//! at the core is fundamental to solid architecture.
//! 2. **Actors can be a Finite State Machine (FSM).** Actors receive and process messages
//! nominally in the order received. However, there are certain circumstances where an actor has
//! to change to another state and process other messages, skipping certain messages to be
//! processed later.
//! 3. **When skipping messages, the messages must not move.** Akka allows the skipping of messages
//! by _stashing_ the message in another data structure and then restoring this stash later. This
//! process has many inherent flaws. Instead Axiom allows an actor to skip messages in its
//! channel but leave them where they are, increasing performance and avoiding many problems.
//! 4. **Actors use a bounded capacity channel.** In Axiom the message capacity for the actor's
//! channel is bounded, resulting in greater simplicity and an emphasis on good actor design.
//! 5. **Axiom should be kept as small as possible.** Axiom is the core of the actor model and
//! should not be expanded to include everything possible for actors. That should be the
//! job of libraries that extend Axiom. Axiom itself should be an example of _micro module
//! programming_.
//! 6. **The tests are the best place for examples.** The tests of Axiom will be extensive and
//! well maintained and should be a resource for those wanting to use Axiom. They should not
//! be a dumping ground for copy-paste or throwaway code. The best tests will look like
//! architected code.  
//! 7. **A huge emphasis is put on crate user ergonomics.** Axiom should be easy to use.
