//! Implements the [`ActorSystem`] and related types of Axiom.
//!
//! When the [`ActorSystem`] starts up, a number of Reactors will be spawned that will iterate over
//! Actor's inbound messages, processing them asynchronously. Actors will be ran as many times as
//! they can over a given time slice until they are pending or have no more messages. If the Actor
//! is Pending, it will be re-queued when the pending future wakes it. If the Actor has no more
//! messages, it will be returned to the Executor until it has messages again. This process cycles
//! until the [`ActorSystem`] is shutdown.
//!
//! The user should refer to test cases and examples as "how-to" guides for using Axiom.
