//! Implements actors and related types of Axiom.
//!
//! These are the core components that make up the features of Axiom. The actor model is designed
//! to allow the user maximum flexibility. The actors can skip messages if they choose, enabling
//! them to work as a *finite state machine* without having to move messages around. Actors are
//! created by calling `system::spawn().with()` with any kind of function or closure that
//! implements the `Processor` trait.
