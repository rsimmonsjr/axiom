//! This is an example of a parallel processing implementation of a Monte-Carlo simulation
//! The simulation is of a basic gambling game adapted from this page:
//! https://towardsdatascience.com/the-house-always-wins-monte-carlo-simulation-eb82787da2a3
//!
//! This example demonstrates:
//! * Using many instances of the same actor to run a simulation multiple times in parallel.
//! * Spawning a manager actor that itself spawns other actors.
//! * Using monitors to allow a manager actor to know when each of its child actors have completed
//!   their work.
